% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{algorithm}

% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Genetic Algorithms}

In this section it's described the proposed solution to solve the PCST problem using AG and dAG 


\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
\STATE
\STATE 
\STATE $t \gets 0$;
\STATE Init(P(0));
\STATE Eval(P(0));
\REPEAT 
\REPEAT
\STATE  $I_1$, $I_2 = Select(P(t));$
\IF{ random $>$ $p_{\text{cross}}$ } 
\STATE $I \gets $ Crossover($I_1$, $I_2$);
\ENDIF
\IF{ random $>$ $p_{\text{mut}}$ } 
\STATE $I \gets $ Mutation($I$);
\ENDIF
\IF{ $I \notin P(t) $}
\STATE Eval($I$);
\STATE Replace($I$, $P(t)$);
\ENDIF
\UNTIL{there's $k$ new individuals in the interation}
\STATE  $t \gets t + 1$;  
\UNTIL{there isn't a better solution after the $\Omega$ iterations;}
\STATE
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Pseudo code of the AG used to resolve the PCST}
  \label{alg:pseudoAG}
\end{algorithm}


First The initial population is created. Each individual of this population encode a tentative solution. A fitness function associate a value to every individual which represent the cost of this solution for the PCST. Then evolution process start where the different stochastic operators, such as selection, crossover, mutation  are applied on the popultion in order to generate a new population. The selection operator choose 2 solution from the current population as parents of the new individual. The probability of seleccion is proportional to his {\em fitness}, so the indiviual with the biggest fitness has more probabilities of survive.

Once the parents are selected, crossover and muration are applied with a probability of $p_{\text{cross}}$ and $p_{\text{mut}}$ respectively, where $0 \leq p_{\text{cross}} \leq 1 $ and $0 \leq p_{\text{mut}} \leq 1$. Finaly the new prpoosed individuals will be included in the new population only if in the population there's not a identical solution, in order to give a minimal diversity to the population~\cite{raidl99}. \\


\subsubsection{Evaluation}
The fitness function is given for the cost function of the PCST, definded in ...


\subsubsection{Enconding}
The first step to design a GA is define a convinient representation model. In the PCST problem all the possible solution are set of trees, which are composed by edges and vertices. If the vertices of the solution are know, the three could be rebuilded using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. That's way the binary encoding $\sigma = (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n)$ of size $|V|$ will be used, where each $\sigma_k$ with value of 1 represent that the vertex is presented in th solution, otherwise will be 0.

Once we have the set of vertices enconded in the chromosome $\sigma$ we can build the solution using the Algorithm~\ref{alg:mprim} which is based on the algorithm of Prim~\cite{580470}. In fact this algorithm has the same cyclomatic complexity of the Prim's algorithm, it mean $O(|V||E|)$ or $O(|E| + |V| \log(|V |))$ if the Binary Heap~\cite{580470} implementation is used.

It's possible that  the algorithm~\ref{alg:mprim}, give as result a disjoin graph. This could be produced in a non-complete graph in which there's not the necessary edges to conecte all the vertices of a factible solution without visit the intermediate vertex. In this cases the subtree with better fitness will be choosen. In that way the best tree is selected.

\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
\STATE
\REQUIRE A graph $G = (V,E)$. 
\REQUIRE Set of vertices $V_T \subseteq V$ in the solution.
\STATE $V_{new} = \{x\}$, where $x \in V_T$ a randomly selected vertex.
\STATE $E_{new} = \{\}$
\REPEAT 
\STATE Choose a edge $(u,v)$ with less weight $u \in V_{new}\, \wedge \, v \notin V_{new} \, \wedge \, v \in V_T $. 
\COMMENT{if there's si hay multiple edges with the same weight, we choose one randomly.}
\STATE $V_{new} = V_{new}  + v$
\STATE $E_{new} = E_{new} + (u,v)$
\UNTIL{$V_{new} = V_T$}
\STATE
\RETURN $G = (V_{new}, E_{new})$
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Modified Prim Algorithm, used to create a feasible solution for PCST}
  \label{alg:mprim}
  
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Initialization}
\label{sec:init}
Typically the generation of the initial population of a AG must created randomly. However, is posible create a initial population in a {\em clever} way, trying to produce better quality solution, which allow to the GA find solutions faster or even better solutions. So two mechanism to create new initial polulation will be used. The first, came up with the inituitive strategy of create random solutions, applying postprocessing algorithm to improve theirs quality. 

When the initial population is created randomly, the resultant three could have {\em leaves} wich doesn't increase the income. On the contrary, including this {\em leaves} on the solution increase the cost of the solution, because the cost of connect this leaf is grater than the income. That's way the prune described in the Algorithm~\ref{alg:poda} is applied to every solution of the initial population, with the propose of remove all the leaves which his prize is smaller than the cost of includ them. 

For the second mechanism the Dijstra Algorithm~\cite{2215313} is used in every vertice with prize greater than 0 giving as result a three which could be prune with the algorithm~\ref{alg:poda}.


\begin{algorithm}
{\bf procedure}$prune(v, \, T = (V,E))$
  \begin{algorithmic}
\FORALL{For all children $u$ of $v$}
\STATE prune($u$, $G$)
\IF{ $c(u,v) > p(u) $ and $isLeaf(u)$}
\STATE $V = V  - v$
\STATE $E = E - (u,v)$
\COMMENT{remove the edge $(u,v)$ and $u$ from $G$}
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Prune to remove leaf wich represent no value to the soltion.}
  \label{alg:poda}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Selection}
The {\em ranking selection} is used, which sort all the solution in asending way according to theirs {\em fitness}. Then you rank each solution from the best solution (rank 1) to the worst solution (rank $n \leq N$); the solutons with the same fitness are ranked with the same value. The best ranked solution have more probability to be choosen.


\subsubsection{Mutation}
The {\em two-point} and {\em bit-flop} mutation will be used.


\section{Parllel Genetic Algorithms}

\subsection{A distribued Genertic Algorithm for the PCST}

There's multiple parallel models of Evolutionary Algorithms, however this research is focus on the parallel model which not only reduce the running time but increase the quality of the solutions as well. That's way the {distributed Genetic Algorithms} (dGA) are used because they are proveen get better quality result in previeus works~\cite{94044, 658089, 590911, 543253}. 

The use of {\em dAG}, include a set of additional parameters. From which, the {\em Migration Gap} and the {\em Migration Rate} must be selected based on the result of theirs peformance. The main parameters of the migration policy include the followeing ones: 


\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Selection of the Migrants}. A elite aproach is adopted, where only the best individuals of the {\em island} are selected to migrate. 

  \item {\em Replacement of the Migrants}.  The immigrant individuals will be incorporated to the population only if doesn't exist the same indiviual in the population, their fitness doesn't  matter. This is done to improve the diversity of the search.

  \item {\em Topology}. The unidireccional ring topology is used to direct the comunitaction between the islan, due his scalability~\cite{Cantu-Paz97predictingspeedups}. \\

  \item {\em Synchronous or asynchronous communication}. we adopt asynchronous comunication for the migrations because the reception of the individuals could happen anytime during the evolution of the island.
\end{itemize}



\section{Design of experiments}
\label{sec:designexp}

In this section the design of experiments used in the different stage of this reaseach is described . Ths allow analyse the behaivor of the peformance of the algorithms implemented trying to resolve the PCST. 


 \subsection{Data Collection}
\label{sec:instancias}
In this research 5 group of instance were used, which are described next.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Johnson tested their approximation algorithms on two sets of randomly generated instances~\cite{338637}. In the first set, called {\em Group P}, instances are unstructured and designed to have constant expected degree and profit to weight ration. The K group comprise random geometric instances designed to have a structure somewhat similar to street map~\cite{minkoff}. this instances has been used for other authors~\cite{1017391, Canuto01localsearch}.

 \item Canuto create sets of test derived from the Steiner problem instances of the well-know OR-Library2~\cite{Canuto01localsearch}. For each one of the instances of the groups 2 instance are generated by assigning zero profits to non-terminal vertices and randomly generated profits in the interval  $[1, maxprize]$ to terminal vertice. 

 \item Ivana use the same scheme of Canuto to generate an aditional set of 40 instances derivated from the E class from the {\em Steiner} Problem of OR-Library~\cite{ivana}. 
\end{itemize}


  \subsection{Design of experiments}
    In the last section show them 
  
  En la sección anterior se muestran las decisiones de diseño que se tomaron para implementar el AG para el PCST. Sin embargo, existen parámetros de los algoritmos genéticos que no pueden ser establecido previamente, sino que deben ajustarse en base a prueba y error. 

  Además, es de gran importancia que que la elección de estos parámetros no sea sesgada en favor de algunas instancias específicas, es decir, que los experimentos en base en prueba y error se realicen sobre múltiples instancias representativas. Además, tiene que haber un balance entre cantidad y representatividad, ya que si se eligen muchas instancias para los ajustes, se invertirá más tiempo del necesario en las pruebas. \\



  En la tabla~\ref{tab:muestra} se enumeran las instancias elegidas para realizar las pruebas, las que muestran ser representativa si se comparan con el conjunto total de instancias, que se pueden ver en el anexo~\ref{appx:infoinstancias}. Además, estas instancias mostraron ser las que presentan mayores desafíos de acuerdo a pruebas previas efectuadas.\\

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
